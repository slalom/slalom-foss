How Slalom participates with the Free / Open Source Software community

Hi! Welcome to the landing page for Slalom's F/OSS. This repository sets forth the vision and plan for creating and interacting with open source software as a for-profit consulting service.

## About us
We’re the doers. The makers.  We’re fiercely optimistic about the future, because we’re helping create it. With teams of technology builders working across North America, Europe, and Australia we are pioneering a movement that helps organizations achieve at the outer boundaries of imagination.

## The Rules
This is a place where we can put up code that is to be shared with the public. Everything here is for the global community and is licensed with a permissive license. That means there are no private repos here. Anything not licensed will be archived or deleted.  
* Open Source.  No private repositoriess.
* Permissive Licenses only (MIT, BSD, Apache)
